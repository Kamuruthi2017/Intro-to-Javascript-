# Intro-to-Javascript-
Created a basic HTML web page and wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
Used multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns and  wrote JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings based on the table columns.
